{% highlight lyrics %}

Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets
And little man, little Lola wants you
Make up your mind to have, no regrets
Recline yourself, resign yourself you're through

I always get, what I aim for
And your heart and soul, is what I came for.
Whatever Lola wants, lola gets
Take off your coat, don't you know you can't win
You're no exception to the rule
I'm irresistable you fool, give in
(Give in, you'll never win)

Whatever Lola wants

Lola gets

Give in (give in, you'll never win)
Give in (give in, you'll never win)
