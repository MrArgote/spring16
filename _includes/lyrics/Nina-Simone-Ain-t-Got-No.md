Ain't got no home
Ain't got no shoes
Ain't got no money
Ain't got no class
Ain't got no skirts
Ain't got no sweater
Ain't got no perfume
Ain't got no bed
Ain't got no mind

Ain't got no mother
Ain't got no culture
Ain't got no friends
Ain't got no schooling
Ain't got no love
Ain't got no name
Ain't got no ticket
Ain't got no token
Ain't got no God

And what have I got?
Why am I alive anyway?
Yeah, what have I got nobody can take away?

Got my hair
Got my head
Got my brains
Got my ears
Got my eyes
Got my nose
Got my mouth
I got my smile
I got my tongue
Got my chin
Got my neck
Got my boobs
Got my heart
Got my soul
Got my back
I got my sex
I got my arms
Got my hands
Got my fingers
Got my legs
Got my feet
Got my toes
Got my liver
Got my blood
I've got life
I've got my freedom
I've got the life
I've got the life
And I'm gonna keep it
I've got the life
And nobody's gonna take it away
I've got the life
