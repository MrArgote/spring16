title:  "A Strong Tremor Adds Excitement To The Mock Test"
---

The day was supposed to be a grueling one.
Two mock tests in the morning and two in the afternoon.
During the first test of the day, when I was there as a proctor, we felt it.
It was a brief but decisive shaking.
Cindy shot up from her seat, anxious and ready to get to safety.
I think we were all reminded of the drone footage of the building complex that collapsed in Tainan a week earlier during a 6.4 magnitude earthquake.
According to the [EMSC-CSEM] website records minutes later, the shake had a magnitude of 5.1 on the Richter scale.
A lighter, shorter shock followed it within the hour, and then it was over.
Everyone back to their tests.
