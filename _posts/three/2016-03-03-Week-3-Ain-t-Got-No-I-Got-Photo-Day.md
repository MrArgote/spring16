*Ain't Got No --- I Got Life*
Lyrics:
Ain't got no home
Ain't got no shoes
Ain't got no money
Ain't got no class
Ain't got no skirts
Ain't got no sweater
Ain't got no perfume
Ain't got no bed
Ain't got no mind

Ain't got no mother
Ain't got no culture
Ain't got no friends
Ain't got no schooling
Ain't got no love
Ain't got no name
Ain't got no ticket
Ain't got no token
Ain't got no God

And what have I got?
Why am I alive anyway?
Yeah, what have I got nobody can take away?

Got my hair
Got my head
Got my brains
Got my ears
Got my eyes
Got my nose
Got my mouth
I got my smile
I got my tongue
Got my chin
Got my neck
Got my boobs
Got my heart
Got my soul
Got my back
I got my sex
I got my arms
Got my hands
Got my fingers
Got my legs
Got my feet
Got my toes
Got my liver
Got my blood
I've got life 
I've got my freedom 
I've got the life
I've got the life
And I'm gonna keep it
I've got the life
And nobody's gonna take it away
I've got the life

*Feeling Good*
Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me.
Yeah, it's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me, ooooooooh...
And I'm feelin' good.

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River runnin' free, you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me,
And I'm feelin' good

Dragonfly out in the sun, 
you know what I mean, don't you know,
Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean.
Sleep in peace when day is done: that's what I mean,
And this old world is a new world and a bold world for me...

Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Yeah, freedom is mine, and I know how I feel..
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
[scat]
And I'm feelin'... good.
