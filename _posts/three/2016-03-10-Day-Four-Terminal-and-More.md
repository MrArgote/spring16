### Lyrics
It could be ten, 
but then again, 
I can't remember 
half an hour since a quarter to four.

Throw on your clothes, 
the second side of Surfer Rosa, 
and you leave me 
with my jaw on the floor.

[Chorus:]
Just when you think 
you're in control,

just when you think 
you've got a hold,

just when you get on a roll,
here it goes, 
here it goes, 
here it goes again.

Oh, here it goes again.
I should have known,
should have known,
should have known again,
but here it goes again.
Oh, here it goes again.

It starts out easy, 
something simple, 
something sleazy, 
something inching past 
the edge of the reserve.

Now through lines of the cheap venetian blinds 
your car is pulling off of the curb.

[Chorus]
Just when you think 
that 
you're in control,

just when you think 
that 
you've got a hold,

just when you get on a roll,
here it goes, 
here it goes, 
here it goes again.

Oh, here it goes again.
I should have known,
should have known,
should have known again,
but here it goes again.
Oh, here it goes again.


I guess there's got to be 
a break in the monotony, 
but Jesus, 
when it rains how it pours.

Throw on your clothes, 
the second side of Surfer Rosa, 
and you leave me, 

yeah, you leave me.

[Chorus]
here it goes, 
here it goes, 
here it goes again.

Oh, here it goes again.
I should have known,
should have known,
should have known again,
but here it goes again.
Oh, here it goes again.
