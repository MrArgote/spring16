## Ball of Eyes

![A Ball of Many Eyes](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b4/ec/88/b4ec88270fdbb3f91ec1d091f79e251e.gif)


This ball is made of eyes.
They are looking in all directions, watching everything, until suddenly they all look at you.

The ball of eyes is
  a little yucky.
  a little dirty.
  a little disgusting.

## Going Into The MRT

There's a man underneath the machine, inside the machine and he is checking the tickets and returning them to travelers.
