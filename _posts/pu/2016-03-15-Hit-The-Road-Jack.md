## "Fly Me To The Moon", by Frank Sinatra

{% highlight song-lyrics %}

Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On, Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

Fill my heart with song
Let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I love you.
