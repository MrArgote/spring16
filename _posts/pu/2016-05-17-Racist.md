The Taiwanese Hip-Hop band 911 released a song called "Foreigner" with a music video on YouTube.

- The song caused a lot of criticism.
- The song was accused of racism.
- I also think the song is racist, misogynist and xenophobic.

- Racism, misoginy an and xenophobia are common around the world and throughout history.

- I think society should be more multi-cultural.
- In my opinion, a society that welcomes people and ideas is a better society.
