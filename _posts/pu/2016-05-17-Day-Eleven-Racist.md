The Taiwanese Hip-Hop band 911 released a song called "Foreigner" with a music video on YouTube.

- The song received a lot of criticism.
- The song is racist, misogynist and xenophobic.
- Those attitudes are common around the world and throughout history.
- What progress have we made in the past 10,000 years?
- How can societies be more multi-cultural?
- Are some societies better than others? Which and how?
- Is a society that welcomes outside ideas and people a better society?


- Colonialism
- Native People
- Slavery
- Economic Exploitation = 經濟剝削

- South European
- Mediterranean Sea

From cell phone to smartphone

The evolution of telecommunications and information technologies.

進化 = evolution

The size of cell phones goes from large to small, to large again.

The size of the cell phones' screens goes from small to large.

Single purpose cell phones become multi-functional mobile devices.
From cell phones to mobile devices.

The antennas are now hidden inside.

- Insects have two antennae.
- insects = 昆蟲
- antenna = 天線

- The shapes of devices have also changed.
- They have gone from thick, long and narrow, to wide, and thin.
- The proportion of the sides of the screen has changed.
- The corners of the devices have also changed.


Cell phones had many more buttons.
Now they are touch-sensitive.

We also have a clock, a letter, a radio, a calculator, a calendar, a telephone, a cassete tape, and a camera.
They are feeling angry.
