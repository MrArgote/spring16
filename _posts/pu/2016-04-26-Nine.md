### Woody Playing Cello

Allen Playing The Cello In An Marching Band .gif

He looks so tired.
He looks very tired.

He looks so tired that people are scared.

Playing a cello in a marching band is tiring.

Not all instruments suit a marching band.
instruments = 工具，樂器
suit = 適合
marching band = 儀隊

The other people think it's strange.
