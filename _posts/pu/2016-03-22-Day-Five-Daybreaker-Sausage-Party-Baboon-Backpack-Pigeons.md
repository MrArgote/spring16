## Sausage Party

- This movie has a lot of profanity.
- Profanity is impolite language, like 'fuck', 'fucking', 'shit'.

Sausages and buns

"The only thing food wants is to go home with us"

- "Over here, we're chosen," said a potato.
- "Frank, we've been chosen together," said the bun to the sausage.
- "We belong together," said the sausage.
- "It's like we were made for each other," she said.

"It feels amazing"

But this summer, food will finally learn the truth.

"They're eating children!" he screamed.

- "So, you've learned the terrible truth," said the bottle.
- "I've got to tell everyone," said the sausage.
- "No one will believe you," said the bottle.
- "I have to try," said the sausage.
- "Everyone will die, otherwise," he said.

"Run for your lives," said one of the bagels.

"Once you see that shit," said the Twinkie, "it will fuck you up for life."
