## Bookmobile

A young woman works on a farm.
Working in the fields is hard work.
When she was young, the fields are all she knows.

In the video, it looks like the fields were grapevine fields.
"The more you know about something, the less you will fear it," said the bookmobile staff member.
"A poor girl."
Books give her courage.
She leaves the camp.

# Radiohead
They are a band.
In the past few days, they released their latest album, along with two music videos.
Radiohead has been making albums since the 90s.

### Burn the Witch

The first music video and song released for their latest album is "Burn The Witch."
It's a stop-motion video.

They are performing some kind of dance, some kind of ritual.

Visitor/foreigner/outsider/inspector?
The mayor
The townspeople/The villagers

We see a noose.
Do they hang people from the noose?

### Daydreaming

Opening doors, going through rooms, into the outdoors, into the beach, into the woods, into the snow.
It gets dark and he crawls into a cave and lies down by a small fire.
