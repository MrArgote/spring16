The Pixar movie *Inside Out* follows the emotional journey of an 11-year-old girl called Riley.
The story begins when Riley, and her parents, move to San Francisco.
Riley will have to adjust to a new school and make new friends.
She has always been a happy person, and now she doesn't know how to manage the sadness of leaving her old life behind.

The movie takes us on a journey into the basic emotions that have led Riley all her life.
This understanding of the mind is informed by the theories of psychologists.
Some of these psychologists are the founders of modern psychology, like Sigmund Freud, and others are still alive and working today, like Paul Ekman.
The movie also is a work of fiction, created in large part by the imagination of filmmakers at Pixar.
They have their own models for what the mind is and how it works.

Some concepts from Freud:

- Consciousness (noun) & Conscious (adjective)
- Unconscious (noun and adjective) & Subconscious (non & adjective)

Some concepts from Ekman:

- Basic emotions: joy, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, surprise and contempt.

Some concepts from the filmmakers:

- Memories and our minds work like computers.

King George is not very good managing his American colonies.
He raised taxes on the American colonies (New York, Pennsylvania, Massachussets, Maine, New Jersey, etc.)
The colonists feel they are taxed unfairly.

The American colonists believed that *taxation without representation* is unfair.
They also felt their concerns were not taken into consideration by the King.
