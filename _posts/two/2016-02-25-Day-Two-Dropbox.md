The winner is chosen by the members of the Academy.
All nominees are white. Most members of the Academy, like most heads of movie studios are white.

There are very few black people in Taiwan, and so black people don't receive many movie awards in Taiwan.

There are many black people in the U.S..
Twenty percent of the US is black.

Are there many black people in U.S. movies?
How many leading roles are played by black actors?

Hollywood movies don't represent/reflect U.S. society accurately.

And African Americans are not the only demographic that is under- and misrepresented.
