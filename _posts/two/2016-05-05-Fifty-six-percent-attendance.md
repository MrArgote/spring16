## Radiohead's Burn The Witch

Is this village normal?

They eat beef.
That's normal.
It's a strange way to make the beef snack.

Is a noose for hanging people normal?
Not nowadays.
But, one or two hundred years ago it was normal in many places.
Today it's rare.
However, towns and countries still kill people.
It's a very traditional town.
They mow the lawns.
They paint their mailboxes.
They have musicians.

They seem familiar, but they live a different way.
They have a ritual where half a dozen men wearing masks and brandishing swords, pretend to sacrifice a woman that is tied to a tree.

This story is like a fairy tale.
fairy = 仙女
tale = story
fantasy = 虛幻的

Fairy tales like... Pinochio...
