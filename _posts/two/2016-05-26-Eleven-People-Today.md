## Doe, a Deer

This well-known song gained popularity through the 1965 movie, The Sound Of Music.

Here are the lyrics followed by a relevant clip from the movie.

Doe, a deer, a female deer.
Ray, a drop of golden sun,
Me, a name I call myself,
Far, a long, long way to run.
Sol, a needle put in thread,
La, a note to follow Sol,
Ti, I drink with jam and bread.
That will bring us back to,
Doe,
Doe,
Doe.

Adjectives:
Very fun.
Exciting.
Crazy. What's crazy about it? How is it crazy?
