## A Musical Game of Note Recognition

Today we played a musical game.
There are seven buttons we can click on, labeled with the names of the seven notes:
From Do, to Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La and until Si.
The goal of the game is to recognize notes.
i.e. Identify each note played.

At the starting level, the game plays a note and the player must click on one of the seven buttons on the screen.
In the second level, the game plays a two note sequence and the player must click on the appropriate notes in order.
In each subsequent level the sequence becomes one note longer, testing our combined skills for note recognition and memory.

Go play [the note recognition, musical game](http://www.learninggamesforkids.com/music_and_art_games/music_and_art_games_music_memory.html)

Adjectives:
- Very fun.
- Exciting.
- Crazy. What's crazy about it? How is it crazy?

- How does the game work?
- How do you describe the game?
- How do you play the game?
- What are the rules of the game?

All of which reminds me of that begins with "Doe, a deer".

## Doe, A Deer

This well-known song gained popularity through the movie, The Sound Of Music.

Here are the lyrics, followed by a relevant clip from the 1965 movie.

```
Doe, a deer, a female deer.
Ray, a drop of golden sun,
Me, a name I call myself,
Far, a long, long way to run.
Sew, a needle pulling thread,
La, a note to follow Sol,
Tea, I drink with jam and bread.
That will bring us back to,
Doe.
'Now children, Do Re Me Fa So and so on
Are only the tools we use to build a song
Once you have these notes in your heads'
'You can sing a million different tunes by mixing them up
Like this'
```

## Visual Tricks

We saw one picture and one video featuring optical illussions.

Optical illusions are visual tricks.

Designing an image that's unexpected.

The first image shows carpeting on a stairwell.
The pattern on the carpeting has many lines and colors.
The pattern is confusing for someone walking on the stairs.
It's hard to recognize where one step might end, and another step begin.

The video features two men doing parkour.
Parkour is a style of running and jumping to move quickly through a series of obstacles.
Watch [five minutes of Parkour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX7QNWEGcNI)
They were doing parkour tricks in a visually tricky way.
It looked like they were jumpking and running through very big items or very small items.

Optical Illussion

Small things turn into big things
Big things become small
